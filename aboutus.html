            <p>(October 22, 2022) When Mafat Patel left home at the age of 23, back in the year 1968, his mother wept to see him go. Mafat had grown up sheltered, spending his childhood on a farm in a village named Bhandu, in Gujarat’s Mehsana district.
                 The farthest from home he had ever been was the neighbouring district of Patan, where he earned himself a degree in Mechanical Engineering. When a friend, who had just returned from the US, asked Mafat’s father to consider sending his son, 
                 the old man jumped on the idea. As did Mafat. And so, in 1968, Mafat arrived in the United States of America, where he studied in Ohio. Global Indian takes a look at the story of Mafat Patel, his brother Tulsi and his sister-in-law Aruna and 
                 how they built the Patel Brothers grocery empire.
                <br><br><br>
                There was no inkling then, in the minds of his family, or even in the farthest reaches of Mafat’s own imagination, that he would go on to build an empire in America. Recently, as I chatted with a friend about the years she spent living in Hoboken,
                 New Jersey, her mother demanded: “Did you tell her about the Patel Brothers supermarkets?” The chain of Indian grocery stores is an absolute go-to for every South Asian in New York, Chicago and Atlanta, a thriving business worth over $140 million. 
                 Mafat Patel, now in his seventies, still walks through the aisles, meeting his customers and addressing many by name as they sip on steaming chai or order hot chapatis.</p>
